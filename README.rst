Using Australian Ports Dataset to Visualise Data
================================================

This `MLHub <https://mlhub.ai>`_ package provides a demonstration of
the concepts of visualising data in order to better understand,
explain, and discover the narrative from our data.

The examples come from chapter 5 of the Essentials of Data Science by
Graham Williams `<https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science>`_.
The data used comes from
`<https://essentials.togaware.com/ports.xlsx>`_.
Further support material is available from
`<https://essentials.togaware.com/>`_.
